# 16. A device for testing defects in a certain electrocatalyst (EC) is envisaged to be advertised by the catalyst producer,
# claiming that it is 97% reliable if the EC is defective, and 99% reliable when it is flawless. Independently from any testing
# device and based upon earlier experience, 4% of said EC may be expected to be defective upon delivery. In order to ascertain
# the true reliability of the device, Bayesâ€™ rule is applied to basic event set A: the EC is defective; A : the EC is flawless;
# B: the EC is tested to be defective; B : the EC is tested to be flawless, equipped with the full set of conditional events of
# interest here with their probabilities:
