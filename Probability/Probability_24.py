# 24. : Imagine that you	have three urns that you cannot see	into. Urn1 is 90%  green balls	and	10% red. Urn2	is
# 50%	green and 50% blue. Urn3 is	20% green, 40% red,	and	40%	blue.	You	canâ€™t	tell	which	urn	is	which.	You
# randomly	select	an	urn	and	 then	randomly	select	a	ball	from	it.	The	ball	you	drew	is	green.
# What	is	the	 probability	that	it	came	from	urn1?
